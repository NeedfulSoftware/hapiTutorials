# AsyncHelloWorld - An example of how to return a promise from a route handler

A minimal server that listens for requests on port 8080 and returns a promise that generates the contents of the page.

## Usage

Install the necessary node modules with the command:
```
npm install
```
Start the server with the command:
```
npm start
```

You should now be able to point your browser at `http://localhost:8080/` and see the "Hello World from async handler!"
message displayed.
